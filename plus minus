/* Harry and Larry are now bored playing with numbers. Now they want to play with plus and minus signs. This time they donâ€™t want to give signs one by one. Anyone can give any number of signs at a time but at most N signs. Can you tell the maximum of all signs that they gave sequentially?

For example:

If the input is 7 + + - + - - - , then the answer is 3 as 3 minus signs are given sequentially and it is the maximum.
If the input is 7 + + + + + - - , then the answer is 5.

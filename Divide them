/* English teacher Mr. Rahim of class Ten asked for the homeworks of the students. Class captain has collected all the notebooks and put them in table. But the class captain put the notebooks of girls first, and then the notebooks of the boys. So Mr. Rahim asked the captain to keep the boy's notebooks to the left side and then the girl's notebooks. If the last index (index starts from 1) of a girl's notebook is K then can you print them in the right order? Note: If K is 0, that means there is no girl's notebook.

/* Phitron planned to throw a party for the students. In the party we found that N students are present. However, as a formality we asked each student to shake hands with each other student. You will have to count the number of unique hand-shakes in that party. N will be an input in your C program and the total number of hand-shakes will be the output. Look at the sample input and outputs for clarification

For example, if N=4 then total unique handshakes will be 6.
